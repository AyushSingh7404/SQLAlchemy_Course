## SQLAlchemy in Python

It is divided in 2 parts:
1. sqlalchemy core --> Contains database, work with connection here.
2. sqlalchemy orm --> Contains the tables and all the OOP's related concept, work with session here.

When using the orm module then,
1. The classes work as tables we do not need to create table using table class.
2. Individual rows as objects.
